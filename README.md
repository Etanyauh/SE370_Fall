### Prework:
If you aren't familiar with Github here are some links: 
* [GitHub Labs](https://lab.github.com/)
* [An Intro to Git and GitHub for Beginners](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)
* [Leanring Git Branching JS](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)     (This one is more interactive!)

### Rundown: 
Project Submissions will be required to implement the following 3 domain names: 
* cq.edu
* yg.com
* lnb.gov 
* Extra domain name to be implemented

### Client-Server, Database & GUI 
* #### Client & Server 
1. The use of a client-server implementation is optional
2. The entire app may be  'one program; not separate client and server programs. 
       
* #### GUI
1. There must be a visual display for the users
2. Requirements are not strict 
       
* #### Database
1. The use of a DB is optional; same for SQL

2. However, the application must be persistent across invocations

3. Therefore the use of a persistent storage medium is mandatory

4. Data may be stored in a text file instead of a database: 
   * The format of a txt file should be in a way that looks like a database table
   * There must be a concept of a primary key
   * A text file must not contain duplicate rows
   
 5. Two messages with the same sender, recipient, subject, and text must be resolved and stored as 
    different messages (They should have different time stamps):
       1. This requirement applies to storage of messages in either a text file or DB. 
       2. If a "reply" is sent to one of the two above messages, the application must identify
          which is the correct original messages that the reply refers to. 
             
* #### Server </br>
    *  Details of the server are left to the team.
